## Own Definition of Big Data
I would define *Big Data* as a **huge amount of data** which can be **noisy, unstructured and/or dynamic**. To store, process or clean this specific type of data, we need to use **non-conventional tools**. If we are doing this, we will gain an **insight/value for the business**.
